bluefish (2.0.0~rc2-0dl1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  This is the second release candidate for Bluefish 2.0. These packages
  will replace your existing bluefish 1.0 installation from the Debian or
  Ubuntu repositories.

  There was further a package split. Binary (bluefish), highlighting files
  and autocompletion data (bluefish-data) and plugins (bluefish-plugins)
  are provided in separate packages. For the case you observe a crash and
  you want to send us a backtrace, the debugging symbols are shipped with
  a separate package (bluefish-dbg) too.

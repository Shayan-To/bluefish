Description: advanced Gtk+ HTML editor (DEVELOPMENT VERSION)
 Bluefish is a GTK+ HTML editor for the experienced web designer.
 Its features include nice wizards for startup, tables and frames; a

 linking of the thumbnail with the original image; and configurable HTML

 you need a web browser that can view local files given to it

Description: advanced Gtk+ HTML editor (DEVELOPMENT VERSION)
 Bluefish is a GTK+ HTML editor for the experienced web designer.
 Its features include nice wizards for startup, tables and frames; a
 fully featured image insert dialog; thumbnail creation and automatically
 linking of the thumbnail with the original image; and configurable HTML
 syntax highlighting.

 For validation to work you need weblint and xmllint. For preview to work,
 you need a web browser that can view local files given to it
 on the command line.

Description: advanced Gtk+ text editor for web and software development
 Bluefish is a powerful editor targeted towards programmers and web
 developers, with many options to write websites, scripts and programming
 code. Bluefish supports a wide variety of programming and markup languages
 and has many features, e.g.
 .
  - Customizable code folding, auto indenting and completion
  - Support for remote files operation over FTP, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAV, etc.
  - Site upload and download
  - Powerful search and replace engine
  - Customizable integration of external programs such as lint, make, etc
  - Snippets plugin to automate often used code
  - Code-aware in-line spell checking
  - Zencoding or Emmet support
  - Bookmarks panel
 .
 but is still lightweight and fast.
 .
 For validation of CSS/HTML/XML documents you need csstidy, tidy, weblint
 and/or xmllint. For preview to work, you need a web browser that can view
 local files given to it on the command line. For PHP or Python bluefish
 supports php-codesniffer and pylint. Tools not suggested but supported
 are make, perl, php5-cli and java-compiler.

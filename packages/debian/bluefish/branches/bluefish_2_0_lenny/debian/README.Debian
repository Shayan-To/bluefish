bluefish for Debian
-------------------

This is an unofficial Debian package. Send comments or bug reports to the
official bluefish lists or to the package maintainer.

Note, that this is a development version of bluefish. So use it carefully(!)
and report bugs (backtraces can be improved by installing
bluefish-dbg).
